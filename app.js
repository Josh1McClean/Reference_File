If a variable has been declared but not assigned a value, or if a function does not 
explicitly return a value, the result is undefined.*/
undefined

/*NULL: A special value that represents the intentional absence of any object value. It is 
a primitive data type and typically used to signify that a variable or object property 
has no assigned value.*/
null

/*OBJECT: A complex data type that allows you to store and organize data using key-value 
pairs. Objects are a fundamental part of the language, and they provide a way to 
structure and represent information in a flexible manner.*/

while "i" is less than "10," and every time I complete a loop, I'll add one to i "i++" (increment++). That
means eventually "i" will become "10" and then we will break out of this loop and stop repeating code. 
Anything inside of the curly braces will be repeated. In the above example I wrote "console.log(i)" and run 
it within the terminal(node.js)/console, we'll get "0"-"9" and ending before reaching "10." This is the

}
console.log(divBy2);
/*EXPLANATION OF SOLUTION ABOVE: Starting with the for loop syntax it didn't matter what I named my variable
(i, j, k), or what my numbered value was (unless a value is specified/requested within the question). So that
is why the for loop in this case is "for (let k = 0; k <= 100; k++)." Next within my curly braces what I
wanted to do was collect all of the values that are divisible by 2, and put them in an array. So I made a
variable to declare an array by writing "let divBy2 = []." Following this, in order to complete the equation
(values that are divisible by two), I made an  if statement with the values of "if (k % 2 == 0 && k !== 0)
divBy2.push(k);" In layman's terms within the if statement When I say "if k mod (modulus) ‚Äú2‚Äù equals (==) ‚Äú0‚Äù
what that is doing is getting the remainder after dividing ‚Äúk‚Äù by ‚Äú2.‚Äù Now if the remainder is ‚Äú0‚Äù, that
means it does evenly divide by two, hence, it is divisible by 2. Then I'm just making sure that ‚Äúk‚Äù is not
equal to ‚Äú0‚Äù because if I do ‚Äú0‚Äù mod ‚Äú2‚Äù, I'm going to get zero even though ‚Äú0‚Äù is not really divisible by
two at least that's the way that I'm going to treat it. Then below the curly braces I wrote
‚Äúconsole.log(divBy2)‚Äù and ran my code which will display all of the different values that are divisible by
‚Äú2‚Äù from ‚Äú0‚Äù to ‚Äú100‚Äù, and I made it that way by pushing them (divBy2.push) into my array. For the additional
problem of ‚Äústop looping once a certain value/number was reached‚Äù I chose to place the value at ‚Äú20‚Äù by
using an if statement.  In order to accomplish this I needed a way to be able to exit it and to stop looping
early. I did this by using the break keyword. It works similarly to how it does in the switch statement, but
what this will do is essentially just egg at the for loop. What I wrote in this case was
‚Äúif(divBy2.length >= 20) break;‚Äù In simple terms this expression is saying that if ‚ÄúdivBy2‚Äù dot(.)
length (checks the amount of values in the array) is greater than or equal to 20 (>=), then I can ‚Äúbreak‚Äù
and if this keyword is encountered it‚Äôll exit the for loop. Once I run the ‚Äúconsole.log(divBy2)‚Äù again
instead of getting all the values that are divisible by two, I‚Äôll only get 20 values instead because as soon
as the length is equal to 20 the code will break and stop looping (which is the certain number of values
that were to be counted)*/

/*EXPLANATION OF SOLUTION ABOVE: To start the solution above I created a variable (numberElements) that will
convert the values prompted by the user in the browser from a string (words) to a number and I'll be asking
user to enter a number between 1 and 10. In simpler terms the code solution above is saying that "if the
number of elements (numberElements) is greater than or equal (>=) to 1 and (&&) the number of elements
(numberElements) is less than or equal to (<=) 10, then anything else will not be valid (else) I will alert
(alert) the user that its not valid with a message (I CAN TELL READING ISN'T YOUR STRONG SUIT!?ü§¶üèø). That was
the first step which was to create an if statement. The next step was to make my "for loop" where I wanted to
grab an element on my screen and append (add/put) different elements inside of it. So if the user entered "5"
I'll be adding numbers "0-4" onto the screen. In order to do this I had to create an element in my js code
so I wrote in my HTML code "<ul id="list"></ul>" which is an unordered list with an "id" of "list" that I'll
be able to grab and append "li" tags within it based on what the user entered. To accomplish this I first
made a variable by writing "let list = document.getElementById("list");" then making my for loop of
"for (let m = 0; m < numberElements; m++)." From here in order to insert a new HTML element I needed to make
another variable under my for loop by writing "let li = document.createElement("li"); (li is the element I'm
creating)." Then to insert/change (append) the text I wrote
"li.appendChild(document.createTextNode(m.toString())); (The text node is text that I want to put inside of
this HTML element." Now that I've created this "li" element I have to put it in my HTML document by appending
it as a child to my list (which is the id I created within the HTML code). In order to do this I wrote out
"list.appendChild(li);" In simple terms the solution is saying that "I created an li tag
(let li = document.createElement("li");), inserted the text inside of the li tag
(li.appendChild(document.createTextNode(m.toString()));), and then inserted the entire tag that now has the
text inside of it within the main list"*/

function. Parameters of a function also have local scope and are accessible only within the function. Local
variables have a limited lifetime, existing only as long as the function is executing. Each function
invocation creates a new scope, and variables declared within the function are not accessible outside of it.
Nested functions create nested scopes, where inner functions have access to variables from outer functions

blocks of JavaScript. They are collections of key-value pairs, where the keys are strings (or symbols) and the values
can be any data type, including other objects, functions, arrays, etc. Objects allow you to organize and structure
your code by encapsulating related data and behavior together. Classes are a more recent addition to JavaScript. They
provide a way to define blueprints for creating objects with similar properties and behaviors. A class is a template
for creating objects, and objects created from the same class share the same structure and behavior*/

you create what's known as "instances" of this class which in this case we could say for example 10 "instances" of the
Teacher class. In layman's terms that'll be 10 individual teachers that have different properties and/or attributes which
allow them to do different things through their methods*/

/*Using Classes & Objects with OOP Were able to use a class to construct our object that allows us to use it (the class)
multiple times to construct multiple objects. In regards to the "person1" and "person2" variables, they're two different
objects that are both the type of person (linked to the person class like the school model analogy). This class (Person)
acts as the type of an object and it's the blueprint on how to construct and interact with these different objects. In
addition to that, whenever we'd want to add a new person to the object we'd simply have to write "new" the name of the
class and the values that are required by my constructor inside of the parenthesis
(ex. const person3 = new Person("Danny", 9);. This would be a great strategy for making the contents of a video game in
my opinion.

Another thing we could do to build on top of this strategy is to add simple methods on to it. In order to define a method
we'd write the name of the method, parenthesis (sayHi(){}) and what I want it to do within the body of the function ({}).
(ex. sayHi() {
        console.log(`Wassup I'm ${this.name} and I'm ${this.age} years old!`);
    })
Once that's done we'd just call the method by referencing my different people and the name of the method together
(person1.sayHi() & person2.sayHi()). The "shouldSayBye" condition is just an example on how to make a method accept
different arguments within it's parameters and to utilize it we could just pass boolean values in its parameters when
calling it back (ex. sayHi(shouldSayBye), person1.sayHi(false), person2.sayHi(true))
